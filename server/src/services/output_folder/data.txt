NMS Awareness
     Experience with Non-Medical Switching
          Summary: Participants shared their personal experiences with non-medical switching, where patients are switched to a different medication for reasons other than the original medicine not working or side effects. Alex shared her recent experience where her insurance company refused to cover her prescribed medication, leading to a three-month gap in treatment. Clarence also experienced a formulary change that resulted in a significant increase in the cost of his medication. Both participants expressed frustration and concern about the impact of non-medical switching on their health.
          Quote 1 - Alex F: I was scared because the medications for PH are life-sustaining. And so, I really did get scared and upset.
          Quote 2 - Clarence W: The formulary change was the cause of this medication needing to be switched because of the cost.
     Insurance Company Decision-Making
          Summary: Participants discussed their perception that non-medical switching decisions are primarily driven by insurance companies for cost-saving purposes. They expressed frustration with the lack of medical justification and the perception that decisions are made by business-minded individuals rather than medical professionals. Jed shared his belief that insurance companies prioritize financial considerations over patient well-being, while Gabe mentioned that insurance decisions are often influenced by copay amounts and cost-effectiveness.
          Quote 1 - Jed F: I really feel like it's always business. They may tell someone on the medical side that, 'Hey, we really think you should approve this.' But I'd like to think in my - that someone with medical training and medical degree would sit back and go, 'No, I don't think so. Let's just stay at the chorus.'
          Quote 2 - Gabe H: In my experience, in my perception, it has been due to, perhaps, the variety of copay that I might be responsible for, in the situations I've been involved with.
     Impact on Patient Health and Well-being
          Summary: Participants expressed concerns about the impact of non-medical switching on patient health and well-being. They highlighted the importance of personalized treatment plans and the frustration of being forced to switch medications that may not be as effective or suitable for their specific condition. Allison, as a nurse, emphasized the frustration of healthcare providers when insurance companies dictate treatment decisions that may not align with the best course of action for the patient's health.
          Quote 1 - Allison D: It's really frustrating, especially with pulmonary hypertension. It's such a serious disease. And if insurance companies want to dictate how you treat someone with severe pulmonary hypertension, that would not work, in comparison to someone with very mild pulmonary hypertension.
          Quote 2 - Clarence W: And the only thing that could be done is if the insurance company made a special compensation for me personally. And I'm not wanting to - if I need to pay for what I need and I've got the resources, I go ahead and do it.
     Challenges in Challenging Non-Medical Switching
          Summary: Participants discussed the challenges they faced in challenging non-medical switching decisions. Alex shared her experience of reaching out to her doctor's office and the insurance company, but not receiving much support or options to challenge the decision. Clarence mentioned that his doctor didn't seem willing to challenge the decision and that the only option would be for the insurance company to make a special compensation. Both participants expressed frustration with the lack of options and the feeling of being powerless in the face of insurance decisions.
          Quote 1 - Alex F: The doctor's office told me that if I wanted to fight with them, that would be fine. But that we just needed to wait those many weeks to get the right heart cath and anything else taken care of. And they said that it would be better if I just left it alone.
          Quote 2 - Clarence W: The doctor didn't seem willing to challenge it. She's just, it is what it is basically. And the only thing that could be done is if the insurance company made a special compensation for me personally.

NMS Taking Action
     The first topic
          Summary: The first topic discussed is the actions that participants would take if they were presented with a medication switch request. Some participants mentioned that they would go straight to their doctors to determine if the switch is safe and appropriate. They would then escalate the issue with their insurance company if necessary. Others mentioned that they would seek a second opinion or contact patient advocates for assistance. The importance of having a good relationship with healthcare providers and the potential need for challenging the insurance company's decision were also highlighted.
          Quote 1 - Allison D: I would go straight to my doctors and be like, is this something that you would consider an appropriate switch or a safe switch? And if they said that they dont believe its safe, then escalating it with my insurance company.
          Quote 2 - Jed F: I would go back to my doctor immediately and not just say Ill go back on this previous medication. I would inquire and want to know more about other medications between these two because there might have been something available that wouldve work the same as this double med works.
     The second topic
          Summary: The second topic discussed is the role of healthcare providers in challenging medication switch requests. Participants mentioned that they would rely on their doctors to initiate the challenge and fight the battle with the insurance company. They emphasized the importance of having a good relationship with their doctors and trusting them to advocate for their needs. Some participants also mentioned the possibility of seeking a second opinion or finding a medical advocate to assist in the challenge process.
          Quote 1 - Gabe H: I would think that my doctor could initiate a challenge and be the person whos sort of fighting this battle over the phone. I would rely on them, and again, if I was at an impasse with my provider I might seek a second opinion.
          Quote 2 - Clarence W: I would go back to my physician first and be more forceful and work with her, work with them if possible and maybe hopefully they would call the insurance company and something might happen that way, but it was in- if I couldnt work with my physician I would call the insurance company myself.
     The third topic
          Summary: The third topic discussed is the potential involvement of pharmaceutical companies in medication switch requests. Participants generally did not consider the pharmaceutical companies to be directly involved in the decision to switch medications. They primarily focused on the role of insurance companies and the need to contact them for resolution. Some participants also mentioned the possibility of contacting the pharmacy for assistance.
          Quote 1 - Alex F: I wouldnt think about the manufacturers of it because it would- it would be Medicare part B that would be dealing with the medications. So I guess insurance. Thats what I- how I see it is that thats who I would- who I would speak to as well as my doctor.
          Quote 2 - Jed F: Insurance all the way because if the doctor does it would be non-medical.

NMS Effects
     Impact on Relationship with Provider
          Summary: Participants discussed how non-medical switching could impact their relationship with their healthcare provider. They emphasized the importance of open and honest communication from the provider about the reasons for the switch and the anticipated outcomes. If the provider did not initiate the conversation or provide adequate information, it could damage the relationship. Participants expressed the need for their provider to take the initiative in challenging the switch and advocating for their care. If the provider did not take the initiative, participants were willing to find another provider who would fight for them.
          Quote 1 - Gabe H: So if they came to me would say, 'Hey, look. Whos this? Whats happening? This is being switched for a non-medical reason. These are the reasons its being switched and these are from a medical perspective, these are the outcomes Id anticipate.' Then that could be, 'Hes- he or she is being honest and straightforward.' And if it didnt go in a positive way, the communication was not done in a positive way, whether its a good communication or a bad communication, it could damage that relationship.
          Quote 2 - Clarence W: I can say that if the doctor responded in a helping way and gave me information that I didnt have like other meds in between, the single inhaler and the one that she prescribed to me, if we had discussed other options I would have appreciated that and I would have known that they were involved and was concerned about my treatment and making sure I had the right med to improve my condition.
     Stability on Medication
          Summary: Participants expressed concerns about the stability on medication and the potential impact of non-medical switching. They emphasized the importance of remaining on their current medication to maintain stability and prevent negative health consequences. Participants mentioned the need for timely access to medication and the potential challenges of tapering off certain medications. They highlighted the stress that comes with switching medications and how it can negatively affect their overall health.
          Quote 1 - Jed F: Just knowing that the longer I go the harder its going to be to get back on a treatment like this, I would definitely feel like Im against the clock and I might have to even skip work just to focus on getting this figured out.
          Quote 2 - Alex F: If I hadnt have been on the medication, would my condition have progressed so much worse? It totally could have had a bad effect on my health.
     Effect on Mental Health
          Summary: Participants discussed the potential impact of non-medical switching on their mental health. They mentioned the stress that comes with the uncertainty of switching medications and the potential negative effects on their mental well-being. Participants expressed the need for stability in their medication regimen to manage their mental health conditions effectively.
          Quote 1 - Gabe H: The side car of stress that comes along with so many of these situations can take a very real and very negative effect on your health.
          Quote 2 - Alex F: I think so yeah definitely because Im already feeling the effects of what I was told yesterday and I felt it before but I didnt pay much attention to it. If I would have been out for those three months I was thinking about that just now, it really would have been not good.
     Trust and Communication
          Summary: Participants highlighted the importance of trust and communication in their relationship with their healthcare provider. They mentioned instances where lack of communication or unwillingness to fight for their care led to a loss of trust in the provider and the healthcare facility. Participants emphasized the need for their provider to advocate for them and provide information about alternative options when faced with non-medical switching.
          Quote 1 - Allison D: Really having a team thatll advocate for you, a prior authorization is someones job. You cant just tell me its not your job without pointing me to the direction of the someone whose job it actually is. I think thats just one of the bigger things. If theyre not willing to fight for you... it can really make or break a relationship.
          Quote 2 - Alex F: I know that hospitals are constantly busy and you got to sit there and wait for several hours to be seen and that sort of thing.

NMS Support
     Support during the non-medical switch process
          Summary: Participants discussed the need for various types of support during the non-medical switch process. Clarence mentioned the need for financial support to lower the cost of medication. Allison emphasized the importance of having a strong physician, nurse practitioner, or nurse coordinator who can provide support and resources without judgment. Jed highlighted the value of seeking advice from someone who has experienced a similar switch. Gabe and Alex both expressed the need for sound medical advice and guidance in making decisions during the process.
          Quote 1 - Clarence W: More support from my physician might have helped but to a larger degree some support financially, not money in my pocket but financial support for lowering the cost of the medication to a point where I could better afford it and take it on a regular basis and treat the symptoms in the best way possible and get rid of them and then come off the meds.
          Quote 2 - Allison D: I feel like having a strong physician or a nurse practitioner or even a very strong nurse coordinator is super important dealing with this and just having people that you know that you can talk to and get support from without being judged or feeling like it's a waste of their time.
