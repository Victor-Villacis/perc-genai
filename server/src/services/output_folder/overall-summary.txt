NMS Awareness2
     Experience with Non-Medical Switching2
          Summary: Participants shared their personal experiences with non-medical switching, where patients are switched to a different medication for reasons other than the original medicine not working or side effects. Alex shared her recent experience where her insurance company refused to cover her prescribed medication, leading to a three-month gap in treatment. Clarence also experienced a formulary change that resulted in a significant increase in the cost of his medication. Both participants expressed frustration and concern about the impact of non-medical switching on their health.
          Quote 1 - Alex F: I was scared because the medications for PH are life-sustaining. And so, I really did get scared and upset.
          Quote 2 - Clarence W: The formulary change was the cause of this medication needing to be switched because of the cost.
     Insurance Company Decision-Making2
          Summary: Participants discussed their perception that non-medical switching decisions are primarily driven by insurance companies for cost-saving purposes. They expressed frustration with the lack of medical justification and the perception that decisions are made by business-minded individuals rather than medical professionals. Jed shared his belief that insurance companies prioritize financial considerations over patient well-being, while Gabe mentioned that insurance decisions are often influenced by copay amounts and cost-effectiveness.
          Quote 1 - Jed F: I really feel like it's always business. They may tell someone on the medical side that, 'Hey, we really think you should approve this.' But I'd like to think in my - that someone with medical training and medical degree would sit back and go, 'No, I don't think so. Let's just stay at the chorus.'
          Quote 2 - Gabe H: In my experience, in my perception, it has been due to, perhaps, the variety of copay that I might be responsible for, in the situations I've been involved with.
     Impact on Patient Health and Well-being2
          Summary: Participants expressed concerns about the impact of non-medical switching on patient health and well-being. They highlighted the importance of personalized treatment plans and the frustration of being forced to switch medications that may not be as effective or suitable for their specific condition. Allison, as a nurse, emphasized the frustration of healthcare providers when insurance companies dictate treatment decisions that may not align with the best course of action for the patient's health.
          Quote 1 - Allison D: It's really frustrating, especially with pulmonary hypertension. It's such a serious disease. And if insurance companies want to dictate how you treat someone with severe pulmonary hypertension, that would not work, in comparison to someone with very mild pulmonary hypertension.
          Quote 2 - Clarence W: And the only thing that could be done is if the insurance company made a special compensation for me personally. And I'm not wanting to - if I need to pay for what I need and I've got the resources, I go ahead and do it.
     Challenges in Challenging Non-Medical Switching2
          Summary: Participants discussed the challenges they faced in challenging non-medical switching decisions. Alex shared her experience of reaching out to her doctor's office and the insurance company, but not receiving much support or options to challenge the decision. Clarence mentioned that his doctor didn't seem willing to challenge the decision and that the only option would be for the insurance company to make a special compensation. Both participants expressed frustration with the lack of options and the feeling of being powerless in the face of insurance decisions.
          Quote 1 - Alex F: The doctor's office told me that if I wanted to fight with them, that would be fine. But that we just needed to wait those many weeks to get the right heart cath and anything else taken care of. And they said that it would be better if I just left it alone.
          Quote 2 - Clarence W: The doctor didn't seem willing to challenge it. She's just, it is what it is basically. And the only thing that could be done is if the insurance company made a special compensation for me personally.
